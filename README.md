# Hexadecimal-Keypad-Scanner-and-Encoder

The project is a Verilog implementation of a Hexadecimal Keypad Scanner and Encoder. 
It scans and encodes key presses from a hexadecimal keypad, providing the encoded value of the pressed key. 
The code includes modules for row scanning, column scanning, key detection, and synchronization, enabling integration into digital systems for keypad input processing.
